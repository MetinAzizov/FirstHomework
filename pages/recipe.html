    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>· 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</h3>
    <h3>· 1 teaspoon sugar</h3>
    <h3>· 1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)</h3>
    <h3>· 1/4 cup canola oil</h3>
    <h3>· 1 teaspoon salt</h3>
    <h3>· 3-1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</h3>
    <h3>· 1/2 pound ground beef</h3>
    <h3>· 1 small onion, chopped</h3>
    <h3>· 1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</h3>
    <h3>· 3 teaspoons dried oregano</h3>
    <h3>· 1 teaspoon dried basil</h3>
    <h3>· 1 medium green pepper, diced</h3>
    <h3>· 2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</h3>
    <h2>How To Make It Step By Step</h2>
    <h3>1- In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.</h3>
    <h3>2- Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain.</h3>
    <h3>3- Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.</h3>
    <h3>3- Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.</h3>
